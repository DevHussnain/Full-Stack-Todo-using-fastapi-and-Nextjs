# Project Name

###Full Stack Todo Application using FastAPI and Next.js

##Description

   This is a full-stack application built with FastAPI for the backend API and Next.js for the frontend. It utilizes JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication and authorization. Users can log in and view their personal data, ensuring data privacy.

##Technologies

1. Backend: FastAPI (Python)
2. Frontend: Next.js (JavaScript)
3. Authentication: JWT

##Data Security

The application utilizes JWT for user authentication. JWT tokens are self-contained and signed with a secret key, ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized access. User data is only accessible to the logged-in user through protected API endpoints that require a valid JWT token.
